  <h4><font color="#436b95"><b>FITNESS </b></font></h4> 
  There is something empowering about seeing and feeling your body becoming stronger and more flexible by working out regularly. Aside from the gym, I’m always down for a hiking/skiing trip to the mountains, and practicing <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/acroyogaomaha/" style="color:#c30b4e;">AcroYoga</a>.
  <h4><font color="#436b95">GAMES</font></h4>
  I've always been drawn to (social) games that offer good stories (Dragon Age, Dungeons and Dragons, The Sims) and/or strategy (League of Legends, Splendor). 
  <h4><font color="#436b95">SELF-IMPROVEMENT</font></h4>
  Over time, I’ve come to realize that many of the skills I’ve picked up from playing video games can actually be applied to real life. There are so many ways to grow and explore that I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface of all that life has to offer. Recently, I’m really into productivity and finances. 
  <h4><font color="#436b95">BOOKS</font></h4>
Growing up I read devoured so much fiction you could say that I was practically raised by them. It’s not an exaggeration to say that books saved and enriched my life in many ways. Tell me which books touched you, and why?

  <dt> BITS </dt>
  <dd> The Bioinformatics and Information Technology PhD Students (BITS) is a PhD students organization in the College of Information Science & Technology (IS&T). The autonomous support group BITS is a forum for peers to engage in collegiate conversation about current topics of interest, their research projects and ideas. This exchange complements the institutional support by the university and college. The interaction among peers is a resource, support, and success factor for doctoral students. </dd>
